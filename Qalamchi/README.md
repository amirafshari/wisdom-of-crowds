# Qalamchi comment analysis

## 1. Scraping
I scrolled https://www.kanoon.ir/Public/EstimateSarasari with selenium IDE and then saved it as html file, then scraped it with bs4, extracted the comments.

## 2. WordCloud
After scraping, I created a wordcloud. From the wordcloud we can see what students are thinking about. The most obvious thing we can see at this time is that they are most concerned about math and arabic.
